Hello Nerdery!

I appreciate the opportunity to get a chance to create this. I actually really enjoyed it and it was a good test to put myself through. I have been giving myself challenges everyday and being able to not "write my own test" was really cool.

I used font awesome style sheet for some icons. I cut the social icons because I didn't know if you wanted exactly those or not. I used font-awesome.css CDN link just so I'm not sending anymore size through email.

I did however have trouble on the connection between the css buttons and dots to the carousel javascipt. I am currently learning more about object-oriented javascript and I didn't want to go passed the suggested time of 12 hours. However, I will still be trying to figure this out after the submission. I would love it if someone could give me a brief explanation on how to utilize the Carousel.prototype.goToNextSlide function. If not I completely understand and thank you again for the opporunity.

Thank You,

Kevin Morales
